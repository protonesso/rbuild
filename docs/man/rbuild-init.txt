Synopsis

*rbuild* init <shortname> <version>

*rbuild* init <label>

-----------
Description
-----------

Creates a working directory for working with the given product.

Example: rbuild init exampleprod 2
Assuming that there were a product defined at
exampleprod.rpath.org@examplens:exampleprod-2, this would create a
product subdirectory tree representing the contents of that product
definition.

Example: rbuild init example.rpath.org@ex:example-2
If your product does not use a standard label layout, or its product
definition was not created through the rBuilder user interface, you
will need to use the label to the product definition directly.
