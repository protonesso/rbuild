--------
Commands
--------

groups

    Build the configured source group. Because it is not possible to detect
    intrabuild dependencies among groups, a single branch should have only one
    source group. If multiple image groups or search groups are desired, they
    should be produced by the single source recipe.

    Requires the caller be in a Stage directory.

images

    Build specified images for the current stage. If no images are specified,
    builds all images definied by the product definition.

    Requires the caller be in a Stage directory.

packages

    Builds or rebuilds the specified packages, or all checked-out packages imagedef
    none are specified.

    Additionally, rebuilds any other packages in the project group that depend
    on the build packages.

platform

    Commits a generic platform definition to the Release stage of the project.
