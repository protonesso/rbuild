rbuild-status rBuild Manual RBUILD-STATUS(1)
============================================

--------
Synopsis
--------

*rbuild* status [--all] [--concise] [--local] [--(no-)product] [--repository]
[--verbose]

-----------
Description
-----------

Prints summary of differences between the local checkout and the repository.
New local changes that have not been committed to the repository are marked
with a leading L character; new changes that have been committed to the
repository but not yet applied to the local checkout are marked with a leading
R character.

If the --concise options is specified, prints a one-line summary for each
Conary source component directory checkout. If the --concise option is not
specified, then all commit messages for versions in the repository that are
newer than the latest local update are printed, and a one-line-per-file
summary of changes made locally but not yet committed is printed.

If the --verbose option is specified, differences within files are printed,
again both for newer changes in the repository and for local changes not yet
committed to the repository.
