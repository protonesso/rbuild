rbuild-checkout rBuild Manual RBUILD-CHECKOUT(1)
================================================

--------
Synopsis
--------

*rbuild* checkout [--derive] [--factory=<factory>] [--new] [--shadow]
[--template=<template>] <package>

-----------
Description
-----------

Check out a package, creating a new package if necessary.

If the project's platform contains a package by the same name, then you must
specify whether to shadow or derive from that upstream version, or to create a
new package by the same name that is not related to the upstream version.

A derived package starts with the contents of the binary package from then
platform, generally used to make modifications that do no require rebuilding
binaries.

A shadow allows you to make changes relative to the platform's source package,
changing how the packages built, and requiring rebuilding binaries.

-------
Options
-------

--derived

    Create a derived package, one based on the upstream binary.

--factory=<facotry>

    If creating a new package, specify its factory.

    Not needed when creating a factory package.

--new

    Create a new version of the package even if an upstream version exists.

--shadow

    Create a shadowed package, one based on the upstream source.

--template=<template>

    If creating a new package, specify a template.
