"""
The rBuild Appliance Developer Process Toolkit handle object

The C{handle} module provides the core objects used for consuming rBuild
as a Python API.  Instances of C{RbuildHandle} are the handles used as
the core API item by which consumers of the python API call the plugins
that implement rBuild functionality, and by which plugins communicate
with each other.
